# ExoScout: AI-Powered Exoplanet Classifier

> Built for the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/challenges/a-world-away-hunting-for-exoplanets-with-ai)

**ExoScout** is an AI-powered tool designed to help scientists, students, and citizen scientists determine whether a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) is likely a real exoplanet or a false positive. It combines a high-performance machine learning model with explainable AI to provide transparent and interactive predictions based on NASA’s KOI Cumulative Dataset.

---

## What It Does

- Classifies exoplanet candidates as **Likely Planet** or **Likely False Positive**
- Provides a **probability score** and **SHAP-based explanation**
- Offers a **Gradio-based UI** for interactive exploration
- Built entirely in Python using open tools, designed to run on **Google Colab**

---

## How It Works

- **Data**: Pulled from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (KOI Cumulative Table)
- **Features used**:
  - Transit features: `koi_depth`, `koi_duration`, `koi_period`, `koi_model_snr`
  - Stellar features: `koi_steff`, `koi_srad`, `koi_slogg`, `koi_smet`, `koi_prad`
- **Model**: XGBoost (binary classifier)
- **Explainability**: SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for both global and per-sample interpretability
- **UI**: Gradio web interface embedded directly in the notebook

## Example Prediction

> KOI with moderate depth, short period, and high signal-to-noise:
```
Prediction: 🪐 Likely Planet (P = 0.92)

Top Contributing Features:
- koi_depth → ↑ increases P(planet) (SHAP = 0.32)
- koi_duration → ↑ increases P(planet) (SHAP = 0.21)
- koi_model_snr → ↑ increases P(planet) (SHAP = 0.18)
```

## Installation (for local use)

```bash
pip install pandas xgboost shap gradio matplotlib seaborn
```

## Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.9
- [NASA Exoplanet Archive API](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- Gradio
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Google Colab (for development)

## Use of AI Tools (Disclosure)

This project directly uses AI via:
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost for classification
- **Explainability**: SHAP for interpreting predictions

No AI-generated images, audio, or video were used. All model predictions and explanations are clearly labeled and generated by team-authored code. No NASA logos or visual assets were altered or used in AI generation.

---

## Why It Matters

This tool helps accelerate the discovery and triage of exoplanet candidates by making classification both fast and explainable. It is educational, reproducible, and accessible—perfect for researchers, educators, and the curious public.
